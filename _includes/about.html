                  <p class="about">Hello, welcome to my website! I'm currently studying for my bachelors degree in Computer Science at Allegheny College.
                    I've been fascinated by computers my entire life, so computer science was an obvious fit.</p>
                  <p>I am currently employeed at Geisinger Medical Center as a foodservice worker and have been for the last 2 years.
                    As an occasional B-code lead I am responsible for supervising the processes and food service team on a daily basis.
                    I am also on the executive board for Gator Activities Programming as the current VP of Internal Operations.</p>
