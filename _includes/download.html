                    <p>I contributed to the GatorGrader automatic assessment tool built and maintatined by students and faculty at Allegheny College.
                    As part of the CMPSC 481 Software Innovation course we were tasked with enhancing the software with LaTeX integration.
                    This was challenging for me and my team, since it was the first time we were exposed to the GatorGrader source code.
                    After 6 weeks of development we implemented fully functional and completly tested regular expression checking as well as a LaTeX sample assignment.</p>
